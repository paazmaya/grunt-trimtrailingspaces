[![Built with Grunt](http://img.shields.io/badge/Grunt-1.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://gruntjs.com/)


## Getting Started

This plugin requires [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) `~1.0` and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
version to be minimum of `10.13.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

Add this to your project's `Gruntfile.js` configuration:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-trimtrailingspaces');
```

Then add `grunt-trimtrailingspaces` to your "package.json" dependencies. This can be done with:

```js
npm install grunt-trimtrailingspaces --save-dev
```

Or by manually editing the `package.json` file by adding the following line inside `devDependencies` object:

```js
  "grunt-trimtrailingspaces": "^5.0.0"
```

Later on it would be possible to install the plugin with the command `npm install`

It can be updated with the command `npm update`, in case there is a newer version in the
[`npm` registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The name to use in your own task definitions is `trimtrailingspaces`.


## Documentation

Add an entry to your `Gruntfile.js`, within the `initConfig` object, which will define the
files of which will the trailing spaces to be removed.

By using the `src` property for selecting files to be processed, they are replaced by the ones processed.

By setting the `failIfTrimmed` option to true, the grunt task will fail after
trimming all files if any whitespace was removed.  This is very useful for
running trimtrailingspaces as a pre-commit task (in combination with
[`grunt-githooks`](https://github.com/rhumaric/grunt-githooks)), because it will
prevent the commit from going through which would not include the trimming
changes.

The examples below are using the [built-in custom filter property](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#custom-filter-function).

```js
  ...

  trimtrailingspaces: {
    main: {
      src: ['public_html/js/**/*.js'],
      options: {
        filter: 'isFile',
        encoding: 'utf8',
        failIfTrimmed: false
      }
    }
  }

  ...
```

It is possible to save the processed files to a different location by using the `files` property, as shown below.
The destination (key) should be a directory path in which the src files (array value) are stored.
No trailing slash needed.

Please note that this method will create a flat directory of the result.

```js
  ...

  trimtrailingspaces: {
    main: {
      files: {
        'public_html/js/trimmed': ['public_html/js/**/*.js']
      },
      filter: 'isFile',
      encoding: 'utf8'
    }
  }

  ...
```

For further information on how files are matched, please see the
documentation of the [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) package,
as it is used underneath Grunt.

To run it:

```js
grunt trimtrailingspaces
```
